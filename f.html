        <p>Food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support for an organism. Food is usually of plant,
            animal or fungal origin, and contains essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins,
            or minerals. The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells to provide
            energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth. Different species of animals have different feeding behaviours
            that satisfy the needs of their unique metabolisms, often evolved to fill a specific ecological niche within
            specific geographical contexts.

            Omnivorous humans are highly adaptable and have adapted to obtain food in many different ecosystems.
            Historically, humans secured food through two main methods: hunting and gathering and agriculture. As
            agricultural technologies increased, humans settled into agriculture lifestyles with diets shaped by the
            agriculture opportunities in their geography. Geographic and cultural differences has led to creation of
            numerous cuisines and culinary arts, including a wide array of ingredients, herbs, spices, techniques, and
            dishes. As cultures have mixed through forces like international trade and globalization, ingredients have
            become more widely available beyond their geographic and cultural origins, creating a cosmopolitan exchange
            of different food traditions and practices.</p>
